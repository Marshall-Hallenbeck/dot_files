## SQLAlchemy Patterns

- When adding a FK to an existing model that's mocked with `SimpleNamespace` in tests, every mock instance needs the new attribute added (typically `=None`). Regex-based replacement across test files is efficient for this.

## Claude Code Skills vs Agents

- Skills are prompt templates (directory with SKILL.md) injected into the main conversation -- they run as the main Claude instance, can interact with the user mid-execution, and inherit all available tools. Best for orchestration and interactive workflows.
- Agents are isolated subprocesses (single .md file with YAML frontmatter including explicit `tools` list) that run autonomously and return a single result. Best for parallel execution and autonomous work. Cannot interact with the user mid-task.
- Colon-based namespace in skill directory names (e.g., `bb:full-sweep`) groups related skills in the `/` completion menu and makes them visually distinct from other skills.
