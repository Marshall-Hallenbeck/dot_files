# Commit Skill
1. Run `git diff --staged` and `git diff` to see all changes
2. Summarize what changed and why
3. Check for: dead exports, stale test assertions, semantic bugs
4. Run tests with `npm test` and verify passing
5. Create a conventional commit with descriptive message
6. Do NOT commit if tests fail
